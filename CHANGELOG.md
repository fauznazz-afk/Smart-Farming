### Improved

- Added chart grid lines, readable X/Y axes, time labels, and per-series Latest, Avg, Min, and Max summaries.
- Kept existing chart data visible while telemetry refreshes to avoid spinner-induced blank charts.
- Improved PV chart color separation between Voltage, Current, and Power.
- Reworked the bottom navigation into a compact, pure frosted-glass navigation panel with a smaller neutral selection pill.
- Added extra bottom content spacing so chart statistics remain visible above the floating navigation panel.
